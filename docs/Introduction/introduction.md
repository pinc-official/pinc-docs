# Introduction

pinc is a template language, which inverses the flow of your data. Instead of you needing to provide all data for your
template beforehand, pinc is asking for new data only when its needed.

pinc also provides the integrating application (for example the CMS) with all information it needs to render a template.
<br /> So in principle it is possible to write content management systems or other applications, which do not need any
kind of configuration files for their templates anymore.
